# Real Time Violence Detection using MobileNet and Bi-directional LSTM
#### This repository is part of the Graduation Project for NTI Training -  AI and IoT DEY Initiative.

## In this Work, we proposed a real-time violence detector based on deep-learning methods.
#### The proposed model consists of a MobileNet Pretrained Model as a spatial feature extractor and Bidirectional LSTM as temporal relation learning method with a focus on the three-factor (overall generality - accuracy - fast response time). The suggested model achieved about 97% accuracy with speed of 16 frames/sec.

## Expirements
### We Implemented Two Prediction Functions To Test Our Model On
#### First Function Perform Frame By Frame Prediction For The Video.



#### Second Function Perform Prediction For The Whole Video..

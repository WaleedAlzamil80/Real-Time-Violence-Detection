## In this Work, we proposed a real-time violence detector based on deep-learning methods.
#### The proposed model consists of a MobileNet Pretrained Model as a spatial feature extractor and Bidirectional LSTM as temporal relation learning method with a focus on the three-factor (overall generality - accuracy - fast response time). The suggested model achieved about 97% accuracy with speed of 16 frames/sec.
